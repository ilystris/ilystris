# Placement Limit

There's two cost groups of items that everything fall into. 

### Group A
High cost items like Cats, doors, basically all PSO2 SG furniture, logic stuff.
You can max have **500** of these high cost items.

### Group B
Small cost cost items like walls/floors/rocks/trees/etc.
You can max have **4000** low cost items. 

These are independent counts so you can have **500** doors and **4000** walls. 

Circled examples of low cost items:
