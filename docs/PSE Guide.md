## Class & Gear
Main class Force or Techter preferred, primarily for compound techniques and bonus damage from using a talis. If Force, use Slayer sub for more crits. If Techter, use Force subclass for PP regeneration. If you are unable or unwilling to main either class, any class works as long as you sub Force. 

For weapons, use a seasonal weapon with its seasonal affix during events. Outside of events, anything 7* or above or Sechtyl is servicable. Weapon ideally should have a fixa fatale, or fixa attack if using sechtyl.
Units should be technique focused. Using the budget augments is recommended. Ajax or Eclaireur only. 

The weapon of choice must have a talis as a multiweapon, or be a talis itself. +70 enhancment with six augments is desirable, but if you are limited in resources, +50 is passable, but do try to upgrade if possible. 
Using the budget augments is recommended. 

More damage means more enemies die during pse bursts. The more enemies that die, means more drop oppurtunities for desired augments and more raw meseta. 
The longer that enemies stay alive, means more missed oppurtunies on drops. So if you have room to enhance your weapon, please do so if possible. 


## How to use the talis / General gameplay cycle
Activate the PA 'Spread Shot' and immediately use any technique to shoot three projectiles forward. Activating spread shot and delaying for a brief moment will cause you to shoot projectiles 360 degrees around you. Use this PA during PSE bursts or clearing mobs to increase PSE bars. We want to use Ice in Aelio so gororons (dolls with big bellies) can freeze. If gororons aren't frozen or hit by a non-ice attack, attack on their front deal close to no damage and charges up their counter attack. Keep in mind that spread shot has a limited duration, so refresh it on occasion by simply using the PA again. 

Each enemy hit by your talis charges your compound techniques. During PSE bursts since many enemies are clumped up and being hit altogether, your compound techniques will charge quickly. Immediately use any compound technique once they become ready to use, then go back to using spread shot. 

Hitting enemies with your talis also charges your skill 'Tricky Capacitator', which deals massive aoe damage in front of you or around you depending on your spread shot state. Use this as soon as it is ready.

**In short, use techniques after using spread shot, and activate compounds or tricky capacitator as soon as they become available.**

The consistent damage, extremely wide spread, charging of tricky capacitator and charging of compounds for force and techter mains makes talis the undisputed strongest mobbing weapon in the current iteration of the game. Using a talis is mandatory for efficient farming in all combat sectors.


## Strategies
This guide is assuming a room is pre-made with friends that are able to coordinate with each other. 

The most common strategy in combat sectors is waiting for four PSE bars (or three depending on the trial) before finishing a trial to initiate a PSE burst. This remains the most efficient strategy for obtaining augment drops and raw meseta.

The first thing to do at any moment in a combat sector is to look at the PSE bar. 
- If it is 2 bars or below, start killing enemies. They do not have to be at the E or T. 
- If the bar is at 3 or 4 and there is no T on the map, continue killing enemies. 
- If the bar is 3 and there is a T on the map, check if it is a Chaos trial or truck trial. Chaos trials are two trials that occur at the same time and have enemies marked with different colors on the minimap. 
A truck trial is one where the players defend a supply track against three waves of enemies. You may need visual confirmation for these. 
- If the bar is at 4 and there is T on the map, **do not kill any enemy that is not relegated to the trial**. Target only trial related enemies which should be indicated on your screen.  

The most important detail that everybody must know is that **defeating any enemy have a chance to decrease the PSE bar**. It is important to note that:
- Killing non-T enemies while at 4 PSE bars will only serve as a detriment, since PSE bursts only trigger when finishing a T. 
- T's sometimes do not trigger PSE bursts despite finishing at 4 bars because the last T enemy might decrease it. (thanks sega)
- The room should always leave Ts with one remaining enemy before reaching 4 bars, so excess T enemies won't decrease it back down once reaching 4 bars prematurely. 

To trigger trials, a certain number of enemies must be spawned. It is why after a PSE burst, if a player were to go around and clear most of the wandering enemies in the map, another trial will instantly occur (PSE bursts stops the spawning of enemies outside of the burst location). The game has a spawn limit coded in and only spawns enemies relevant to the players' locations. 
- To spawn more enemies, simply defeat the ones around you, or use a teleporter that has no other players nearby. 


## Tips
- **Use the teleporters.** If you have no enemies on your radar, use a teleporter. If the trial is far away from you but closer to a ryuker, use the teleporter. Once a PSE burst ends and the majority of the party goes in a certain direction, use the teleporter to split off.
- Megalotix starless bosses spawn extra mobs after enraging, so take care of those bosses first in double boss chaos trials and be mindful of it when seeking 4 bars prior to completing the trial.
- Find the block with the lowest population to play in so spawns in PSE bursts occur at a consistent rate.
- PSE bars have a five second cooldown after decreasing or increasing. If you have a lot of enemies in front of you and the bar just moved, wait a brief moment before continuing to attack.
- Wandering enemies usually come with two or three strong mobs and a bunch of weak ones. Strong mobs include pettas variants, metius variants, or any other large-sized enemy. It is more efficient to simply kill the weak mobs and ignore the large ones, as the large enemies will despawn overtime and the provide no additional benefit over weak enemies when defeated. 
- During PSE bursts, mobs do not always spawn in a close vicinity to each other in some locations. If so, find the right angle where your spread shot techniques are able to pierce through the most enemies for increased efficiency. 
- When at 4 bars and having one last enemy at the T, it is courteous to wait for everybody to arrive to the trial area before defeating the last trial enemy.
- All combat sectors have a PSE pity timer of about five minutes of having no PSE burst. During pity, the bar will no longer decrease. If you have friends available who can AFK in two separate rooms, two parties with a total of seven people are able to swap back and forth between each room and never need to worry about the PSE bar decreasing since it will usually always be in pity mode. 
- If you hold down a button on your mouse and alt-tab to another window at the same time, the game will think that you are still holding down that button. When you tab back in, your character will continue attacking, assuming you alt-tabbed while holding down a mouse button for techniques while in spread shot for instance. This can be stopped only through clicking the same button manually again. This also means you can bind a technique to mouse wheel for example, then bind spread shot to shift+mouse wheel. When you auto-attack with mouse-wheel and you hit shift, your character will use spread shot to refresh its duration and still continue attacking after you let go. This could help make PSE bursting less fatiguing.
