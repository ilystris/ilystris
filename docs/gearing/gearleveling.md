# Unit Leveling

## 0 to +50
Just slap one ***Gold Primm Armor II*** on it. Instant +50.

## +50 to +60
Requires ***4x Arms Refiners*** and ***2x Arms Refiners II*** for the rarity that eclair is.

## +60 to +61
Requires ***6x Arms Refiner*** and ***3x Arms Refiner II***.
This is a very important breakpoint because at +61 you get the 6th augment slot which is a big potency boost. 
The experience required to level after +60 is increased by a lot, you will need 10 Gold Primm Armor II for one level, or 5 if you get a great success (a use for those 100% great success items!).

## +61 to +70
This just gives a bit of armor and is not that important however can be accomplished over time as you get **Gold Primm Armor II** from doing content. 

## Arms Refiner
Can be dropped in random content like UQ, LQ or even regular PSE farming. You also get Strugment A/B/C from almost every type of content or for 1-4k/each on the store, these can be traded into Arms Refiner as well.

## Arms Refiner II
Arms Refiner II is a rare drop from UQ's and LQ's as well, and a pretty rare drop in Neusen Plant combat zone from Trials (ask for mpa to farm trials only!)
You can get 2 per week from the Item Lab NPC by turning in regular Arms Refiners. You can also get another 2 per week from Arks Record badges.

You can also get 5 Arms Refiner II from each run of the looping Aelio Relentless task. You also get chunks and 10x Mastery IV and a bunch of SG so it's well worth doing.

# Weapon Leveling
Same as above but different arms refiner amounts required. However in the case of weapons, getting it to +70 is **very important** due to the base attack power increase.
